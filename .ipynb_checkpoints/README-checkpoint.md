NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental Python library for scientific computing and numerical operations. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a vast collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

## Key Features of NumPy:

1. ndarray (N-dimensional array):
    - NumPy's core feature is the ndarray, a fast and memory-efficient array object for handling large datasets.
    - Supports vectorized operations (eliminating the need for loops).

2. Mathematical Functions:
    - Provides linear algebra, Fourier transforms, random number generation, and more.
    - Optimized for performance (written in C and Fortran).

3. Broadcasting:
    - Allows operations on arrays of different shapes.

4. Interoperability:
    - Works well with other libraries like Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

5. Memory Efficiency:
    - Uses contiguous memory blocks, making it faster than Python lists.
